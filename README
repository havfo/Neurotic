The program is run from the command line with the parameters "number of neurons", "neighbourhood size", "number of iterations", "steps before outputting", "learning rate" and "path name"

The parameters are int, int, int, int, double, String

Example parameters would be:

50 30 500 50 0.3 ws.tsp

It works best with around 2:1 neuron to cities ratio and large (60% of neurons~) neighbourhood size for small problems and smaller (40%~ of neurons) sizes for larger problems.

NOTE: Whether or not Java interprets . or , as the proper way to separate decimals seem to be dependant of your regional settings. You might have to convert , to . to get it to run.
